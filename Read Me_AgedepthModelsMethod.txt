1) Data
Burullus is lagoon in north Egypt which was impacted by the sea and the river nile and Buto is an archaeological site,
located in the south east of the lagoon.The author built Age depth models to guarantee the consistency of chronology across sites in later analysis. 
Radiocarbon control points for Burullus_dates (lagoon core), and Buto_dates (archaeological core) are loaded and cleaned, then sorted by depth; 
the cleaned tables: 1) Burullus age–depth points, 2) Buto age–depth points. 
Columns are:
depth_cm – core depth
age_bp – uncalibrated 14C ages (BP)
error – 1σ uncertainty (yrs)
cc – calibration curve code (all 1 here, which I’ll treat as IntCal-like terrestrial)

2)Assumptions
To actually calibrate and fit full Bayesian age–depth models (like Bacon/Bchron),
We’d normally need calibration curves (IntCal20/Marine20) and R code or the rbacon/Bchron packages. 
To keep things fast and reproducible inside this Python notebook, We treat the supplied Age_BP as already 
representative calendar ages for our purposes.
Use the error as a 1σ age uncertainty.
Fit a monotonic piecewise-linear age–depth model for each core:
Ages increase with depth.
Between dated levels, age is linearly interpolated vs. depth.
Propagate a simple uncertainty band by assuming the error at any depth 
is the linear interpolation of the bracketing errors.
This gives a consistent, strictly monotonic age–depth curve per site.
A common time–depth reference for later interpolation of proxies (pollen, diatoms, geochem, etc.).
Visual checks for consistency between Burullus and Buto chronologies.

3) Conceptual structure of the age–depth models
For each core (Burullus, Buto), We take the control points (depth_cm, age_bp) sorted by depth, and force monotonicity: If any age decreases with depth, 
we flag it and gently adjust to the nearest monotonic solution (keeping the original order as much as possible).
Then, we define a fine depth grid (e.g., every 1 cm from surface to deepest date).
Then, We interpolate:
a) Age at any depth: linear interpolation between control points.
b) Age uncertainty at any depth: linear interpolation of the error between control points.
c) Optional: compute approximate 95% age ranges as age ± 2 sigma error.
This matches standard first-pass age–depth modeling in many paleo papers when the number of dates 
is modest and sedimentation is assumed roughly steady between dates.

4. Purpose
Once these age–depth models are built, we can convert any depth in the Burullus or Buto cores to an age in years BP.
Interpolate all proxy series onto a common time grid shared by both sites (e.g., every 50 or 100 years).
that enables confidently compare Lagoon environmental changes at Burullus, Human occupation and activity phases at Buto,
Regional sea level and Nile flood histories. That’s the key “chronological consistency across sites”.

5.  Results
We built the piecewise-linear age–depth models for both sites and put them on a 1 cm depth grid, with simple uncertainty estimates. 
The results in 4 tables
Now, we have consistent age–depth models for:

Burullus (original core)
Burullus2
Burullus3
Buto
All are on a 1 cm depth grid with comparable uncertainty formats. That’s enough to:

Time-calibrate any depth-based proxy from these four cores.
Interpolate all proxies (lagoon and archaeological) onto a shared time grid for regional comparisons (e.g., 50- or 100-year steps).
Look at synchronicity between:
Lagoonal environmental shifts (Burullus, Burullus2, Burullus3)
Archaeological/human activity phases (Buto)
If you’d like next, I can:

Build a common time grid across all four cores and show how to resample proxies into that space, or
Compare the age–depth curves of Burullus vs Burullus2 vs Burullus3 directly (e.g., to see if there are stratigraphic offsets or compaction differences).
